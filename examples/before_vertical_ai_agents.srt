1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,901
Every three months, things have just
kept getting progressively better, and now...

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:07,504
...we're at this point where we're
talking about full-on vertical AI agents that...

3
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:11,050
...are going to replace entire teams
and functions and enterprises.

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,630
That progression is
still mind-blowing to me.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,030
A lot of the foundation
models are kind of coming head-to-head.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,850
There used to be only one
player in town with OpenAI, but we've...

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,000
...been seeing in the
last batch this has been changing.

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:24,940
Thank God.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,332
I was like, competition is, you know,
the soil for a very fertile marketplace...

10
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:35,523
...ecosystem, uh, for which consumers
will have choice, and, uh,...

11
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:39,719
...founders have a shot,
and that's the world I want to live in.

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,219
Welcome to another episode of
The Light Cone. I'm Garry.

13
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,420
This is Jared, Harj, and Diana.

14
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:55,781
And collectively, we funded hundreds
of billions of dollars worth of...

15
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:59,899
...startups right when they were just one
or two people starting out.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:07,519
And today, Jared is a man on fire,
and he's going to talk about vertical AI.

17
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:08,840
Yes, I am.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,081
I am fired up about this
because I think people, especially...

19
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:18,044
...startup founders, especially young
ones, are not fully appreciating...

20
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,750
...just how big vertical
AI agents are going to be.

21
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,859
It's not a new idea.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,278
Some people are talking about vertical AI agents,
we funded a bunch of them, but I...

23
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:29,109
...think the world has not caught on
to just how big it's going to get.

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,385
And so I'm going to make the case
for why I think there are going to be...

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:39,819
...$300 billion-plus companies
started just in this one category.

26
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,510
Nice.

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,679
I'm going to do it by analogy with SaaS,
and I think in a, in a similar fashion,...

28
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:49,470
...people don't understand just how big
SaaS is because most startup founders,...

29
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,568
...especially young ones, tend to see the
startup industry through the lens of the...

30
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:57,622
...products that they use as a consumer,
and as a consumer, you don't tend to...

31
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:01,319
...use that many SaaS tools
because they're mostly built for companies.

32
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,953
And so I think a lot of people have
missed the basic point that if you just look...

33
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:08,669
...at what Silicon Valley has been funding
for the most, for like, for the last...

34
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,229
...20 years, like, we've mostly
been producing SaaS companies, guys.

35
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,669
Like, that's literally been like most of
what has been coming out of Silicon Valley.

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,134
It's over 40% of all venture capital
dollars in that time period went to...

37
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:25,114
...SaaS companies, and we produced over
300 SaaS unicorns in that 20-year...

38
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:29,599
...time period, which is way
more than every other category.

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,740
Software's pretty awesome.

40
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:30,870
Yeah.

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,319
Software is pretty awesome.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,886
I was thinking back to the history of
this because we, we always like to talk about...

43
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:41,460
...the, sort of how the, how
the history of technology informs the future.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,742
And, um, the, the real
catalyst for, for this SaaS boom...

45
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:49,219
...was, uh,
do you guys remember XMLHTTPrequest?

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,329
Oh my God.

47
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,360
Like, I- I'd argue that that was
quite literally the catalyst for the SaaS boom.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,659
Like, uh, AJAX?

49
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,740
AJAX, yeah.

50
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,619
In 2004, browsers added this JavaScript
function XMLHTTPrequest, which was the missing...

51
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:05,199
...piece that enabled you to build a
rich internet application in a web browser.

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,111
So, for the first time you
could make things in websites that...

53
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,343
...looked like desktop applications,
and then that created Google...

54
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:14,259
...Maps and Gmail and set up this whole,
like, SaaS boom.

55
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,400
Essentially, the, the key technology
unlock was that software moved from...

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,123
...being a thing that you got on a CD-ROM
and installed on your desktop to...

57
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:25,620
...being something that you use through
a website and on your phone.

58
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:26,159
Yeah.

59
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,833
Paul Graham actually, uh, shares in that lineage
in that he was one of the first...

60
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:35,599
...people to realize that he could take the
HTTP request and then actually hook it up...

61
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,277
...to a Unix prompt, and you didn't
actually have to, you know, have a separate-...

62
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:44,479
...Yeah. ... computer program- Yeah. ...
that would change a website.

63
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,519
So, ViaWeb was a, uh, online store, kind
of like Shopify, but way back in the day.

64
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,370
Yeah, it was basically like the
first SaaS app ever. Like, like- Right.

65
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,740
PG actually invented SaaS in like 1995.

66
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,325
It's just that those first SaaS
apps kind of sucked because they...

67
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,005
...didn't have XMLHTTPrequest,
and so every time you would like...

68
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:03,740
...click a button,
it would have to reload the whole page.

69
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,904
And so it's just a shitty experience,
and so it didn't really...

70
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:09,240
...catch on until 2005
when X- XMLHTTPrequest widespread.

71
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,750
Anyway, I, I see this LLM
thing as like actually very similar.

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,127
Um, it's like it's a new
computing paradigm that makes it possible...

73
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:19,660
...to just like do
something fundamentally different.

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,287
And in 2005, when cloud and mobile finally
took off, there is this sort of like...

75
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:28,769
...big open question of like,
okay, well, this new technology exists.

76
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:32,129
What should you do with it?
Where is the value going to accrue?

77
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:34,009
Where are the good
opportunities for startups?

78
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,242
I was going through the list of
like all the billion-dollar companies who were...

79
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:42,400
...created, and I kind of had this
realization that you could kind of bucket...

80
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,100
...the different paths
that people took into like three buckets.

81
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,351
Um, there's, there's a first bucket that
people started with, which was like I would...

82
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,230
...call them obviously good ideas
that could be mass consumer products.

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,207
Um, so that's like docs,
photos, email, calendar, chat, all...

84
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:04,536
...these things that like we used
to do on our desktop, but that...

85
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:08,079
...obviously could be moved to the browser
and to mobile.

86
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:12,702
And the interesting thing
is zero startups won in those categories.

87
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,670
100% of the value flowed to incumbents,
right?

88
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,240
Like Google, Facebook, Amazon, they
own all, all those businesses.

89
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,154
Folks forget that, like,
Google Docs wasn't the only company...

90
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,370
...that tried to
bring Microsoft Office online.

91
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,046
There were like 30 companies
that tried to bring...

92
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:28,129
...Microsoft Office online,
but they all lost.

93
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,180
Google won.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,394
Then there was like a second category,
which was like mass consumer...

95
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:36,910
...ideas that were not obvious
that nobody predicted.

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,259
Um, that's like Uber,
Instacart, DoorDash, Coinbase, the- Airbnb.

97
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,120
New marketplaces.

98
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,522
Those ones, those ones came out
of left field like the, the dot-dot-dot...

99
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:52,379
...between XMLHTTPrequest
and Airbnb is like very not obvious.

100
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:52,949
Yeah.

101
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,940
And so the incumbents
didn't even try competing in...

102
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,740
...those spaces
until it was like too late.

103
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,569
And so startups were able to win there.

104
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,508
And then there's a third category,
which is all the B2B...

105
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,620
...SaaS companies,
and that's like 300 of them.

106
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,013
And so like mo- Like by, by,
by number of logos, way more billion-dollar...

107
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:12,959
...companies were created in
that third category than the first two.

108
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,217
I think one reason why
that happened is like...

109
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:19,235
...there is no......
like Microsoft of SaaS.

110
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,799
Like, there is no company
that somehow does, like, SaaS...

111
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,156
...for, like,
every vertical and every product.

112
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:27,457
Like, for structural reasons, it seems
to be the case that, like, they're...

113
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,576
...all different companies
and that's why there's so many of them.

114
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:34,036
I think Salesforce is probably,
like, the first true SaaS company.

115
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:34,185
Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:40,526
Um, and I, I remember Marc Benioff coming
to speak at YC and he tells a story.

117
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:42,235
It's just very early on.

118
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,501
People just didn't believe
you could build sophisticated enterprise...

119
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,286
...applications, like, over the
cloud or via SaaS. Yeah.

120
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:51,446
It was just so, um ... There
was just, like, a perception issue, right?

121
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:54,338
It was like, no, like you don't, you
buy, like, your box software and that's, like,...

122
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:56,766
...the real software that you run your-
This is the way we always do it.

123
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,536
It was, it was quite contrarian
'cause the early web apps sucked.

124
00:06:59,576 --> 00:06:59,706
Yup.

125
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:03,030
They were, like, via web, where you had to
be a visionary like PG and understand- ... that...

126
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,045
...the browser was going to keep getting
better and that eventually it'd be good.

127
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,745
Which feels like quite
reminiscent of today, right?

128
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:08,925
Yeah.

129
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:11,045
Where it's like the, yeah, the same thing.
Like, oh, no.

130
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:15,390
Like, you won't be able
to build, like, sophisticated enterprise applications...

131
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,608
...that use these LLM or AI tools
because they hallucinate or they're...

132
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:21,755
...not perfect or they,
um, they're kind of like just toys.

133
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,055
But yeah, that's like the
early SaaS story exactly the same.

134
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:28,916
And so when I think about the
parallels with LLMs, I could easily imagine...

135
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,436
...this same thing happening, which is
that there's a bunch of categories...

136
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:36,790
...that are like mass consumer
applications that are obviously huge opportunities,...

137
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,836
...but probably the
incumbents will win all of those.

138
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,431
So, that's something like a pur- like
a general purpose AI voice assistant that you,...

139
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:46,615
...you know, you can ask it to do
anything and it'll, like, go do that thing.

140
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,192
That's an obvious thing that should exist,
but like, all the big...

141
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:51,696
...players are going to be
competing to be that thing, right?

142
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:54,935
Wow, Apple's a little slow on that one.
Why is Siri so stupid still?

143
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:57,315
What year is it? It makes no sense.

144
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,156
I mean, it's interesting.

145
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:01,915
Like, a count to that is, like, the
very obvious thing is search and maybe Google...

146
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,981
...will still win, um, on search, but
Perplexity is definitely give them a- Give...

147
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:09,315
...them a run for their money.
... huge run for their money, right?

148
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:09,375
Totally.

149
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:11,915
Yeah, this is the classic innovator's
dilemma at the end of the day.

150
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:15,793
I mean, you could argue, going back
to what you said about Uber or Airbnb,...

151
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:19,985
...these were actually really
risky things from a regulatory standpoint.

152
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:20,305
Yeah.

153
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:24,754
So, if you're Google and you
have basically a guaranteed, you know, giant,...

154
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,722
...uh, pot of gold that, you know,
sort of comes to you every single month,...

155
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:32,299
...like, why would you endanger that pot
of gold to sort of pursue these...

156
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,725
...things that, uh, might be scary
or might ruin the pot of gold?

157
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:39,901
I think that's a, I think that's,
like, probably the primary reason why the incumbents...

158
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,806
...didn't end up building those products
and didn't even clone them, even after...

159
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:45,755
...they got big and it was obvious that,
that they were going to work.

160
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:49,705
Google never launched an U- an Uber clone.
They never launched an Airbnb clone.

161
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:54,520
Um, I was listening to this, uh, talk by
Travis and one of the things that he said that...

162
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,495
...really stuck with me is that in the,
in the first years of Uber, he was very...

163
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:02,635
...scared that he was going to personally
go to prison for like, a long time.

164
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,624
Like, he was actually
personally risking going...

165
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,275
...to prison in order to build
that company.

166
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:09,576
And so yeah, no highly paid
Google exec was going to do that.

167
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:15,015
What do you think about, um, why
the incumbents didn't go into B2B SaaS?

168
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:19,144
Is it part of the reason is
that a lot of the use cases are very ...

169
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:20,855
There's a very wide distribution?

170
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:24,155
I ... It's a great question.
I love to hear what you guys think.

171
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:30,296
My take is that it's just too hard
to do that many things as a company.

172
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:34,622
Like, each B2B SaaS company really
requires, like, the people who are...

173
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:38,367
...running the product and the business
to be extremely deep in one domain...

174
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,816
...and care very deeply
about a lot of really obscure issues.

175
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,525
You know, like, take,
like, Gusto for example.

176
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:45,716
Like, why didn't Google
build a Gusto competitor?

177
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:49,545
Well, there's no one at Google who
really understands payroll and has the patience...

178
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:53,387
...to, like, deal with all the nuances
of all these, like, stupid payroll regulations...

179
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:56,596
...and like, it's just like,
like, it's just not worth it for them.

180
00:09:56,615 --> 00:10:00,676
It's easier for them to just focus on,
like, a few really huge categories.

181
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:06,140
In the B2B SaaS world, it's, it's
sort of about the unbundling, bundling of software...

182
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:12,066
...argument that comes up a lot as well, I
think, and why didn't, why did all these vertical...

183
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:17,556
...B2B SaaS products evolve versus just,
like, Oracle or SAP or, um- NetSuite.

184
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:19,995
Yeah, NetSuite,
just owning, like, everything.

185
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:22,705
Um, and I think it might be als- ...

186
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:26,374
There's another thing that's attributable to
the shift to, like, SaaS and...

187
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:29,965
...the internet is in the old ways
of selling software, again, like, you had...

188
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:33,428
...this box software that was really,
like, expensive to install and you...

189
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:36,776
...had, like, a whole ecosystem around it,
and anytime you wanted something...

190
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:39,816
...custom, like,
the integrators would just say, "Oh, no.

191
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:43,915
Like, we can, like, just build you
a custom, like, payroll feature or something...

192
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:47,609
...like that." And then Salesforce comes
along with, like, a SaaS solution and...

193
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:51,411
...it just seems like it could never be
as powerful or sophisticated as,...

194
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:54,855
...like, the expensive
enterprise installation you just paid for.

195
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,808
But they proved that it totally
was the case, and I think that...

196
00:10:57,808 --> 00:11:00,831
...just, like, opened the gates
for all of these, like, vertical...

197
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:04,056
...SaaS solutions to emerge
doing exactly what you're saying.

198
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:07,932
I think the other problem is that
with a lot of this enterprise software, if...

199
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:11,824
...you're a user of Oracle and a NetSuite,
because they're, they have to...

200
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:15,914
...cover so much ground, the
user experience is actually pretty bad.

201
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:18,196
They're trying to be jack of all trades,
but master of none.

202
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:18,755
Yeah.

203
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:22,056
So, it ends up being a bit
of a kitchen sink type of experience.

204
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:26,885
And this is where if you go and
build that B2B SaaS vertical company, you could do...

205
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:31,457
...literally a 10 X better experience
and more delightful because there's this stark...

206
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:36,216
...difference between consumer products
and enterprise user experience.

207
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:36,565
Yeah.

208
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,975
Well, there's only, uh, what?
Three price points in software.

209
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:46,235
It's, uh- ... $5 per seat,
$500 per seat, or $5,000 per seat.

210
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:51,775
And, uh, that maps directly
to consumer SMB or enterprise sales.

211
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:56,240
And then I think time immemorial has
taught us that in the past, and this...

212
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,019
...is less and less true, uh,
with new software thankfully, but enterprise...

213
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,296
...is terrible software
because it's not the user buying it.

214
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:10,281
You know, some high up mucky-de-muck inside
a Fortune 1000 is the person who's getting...

215
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:14,739
...wined and dined for this, you
know, mega seven-figure contract and, you know,...

216
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:19,652
...they're-... going to choose something that
maybe isn't that good actually for the...

217
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:24,442
...end user, the person who has
to actually use the software day-to-day.

218
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:30,192
And, um, I'm sort of curious to
see how this changes with LLMs actually.

219
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:34,229
I mean, to date, one of the more
salient things that we've seen for both SMB...

220
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:38,569
...and enterprise software companies is
that, or all software companies, all...

221
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:42,746
...startups, period, is like, you know,
there's a sense that as revenue...

222
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:46,261
...scales, the number of
people you have to hire scales with it.

223
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:53,010
And so, when you look at unicorns,
uh, even in today's YC portfolio, uh, it's...

224
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,084
...quite routine to see a company that
reached 100 or $200 million a year in...

225
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:02,572
...revenue, but they have like 500,
1,000, 2,000 employees already.

226
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:06,634
And I'm just gonna be very curious,
like, uh, even the advice that I'm...

227
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:10,174
...starting to give companies that are,
you know, a month or two out of...

228
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:14,179
...the batch, uh, it's, uh, it's
feeling a little bit different than...

229
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,201
...the kind of advice I would
give last year or two years ago.

230
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:21,655
In the past you might say, you
know, "Let me find the absolute smartest...

231
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:26,167
...person, uh, in all of these
other parts of the org, like customer...

232
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,591
...success, or sales,
or different things like that.

233
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:33,926
And, uh, I want to find someone who I've
worked with, who is, I know is great, and...

234
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:38,207
...then I'm going to go sit on their,
you know, uh, uh, on their doorstep until they...

235
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:42,004
...quit their jobs and come work for me."
"And I want them to be someone who can,...

236
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:45,963
...you know, build a team for me, hire
a lot of people." That might still be true,...

237
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:49,631
...but I'm starting to sense that,
uh, the meta shifting a little bit.

238
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:54,644
Like, you actually might want to
hire more really good software engineers who...

239
00:13:54,644 --> 00:14:00,173
...understand large language models, uh,
who can actually automate the specific...

240
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,851
...things that you need
that are the bottlenecks to your growth.

241
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:08,897
And so it might result in, you know,
a very subtle but, you know, significant change in...

242
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:13,011
...the way startups grow their businesses,
sort of post-product market fit.

243
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:17,377
It means that I'm going to
build LLM systems that bring down my...

244
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:21,272
...cost, that cause me
not to have to hire 1,000 people.

245
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,621
I think we're right at the beginning of
that revolution right now.

246
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:26,331
I mean, we talked about
this in a previous episode.

247
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:30,214
We talked about there will
be a future unicorn company that's only...

248
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:34,081
...run, if we take it to the limit,
with only 10 employees.

249
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:36,211
That's completely plausible.

250
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:38,261
And they're writing the evils
and the prompts.

251
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:39,351
That's it.

252
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:42,432
I think what you're saying is like a trend
that was already underway pre-LLMs.

253
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:47,035
Like, I remember when I was running
Triplebyte, for example, we needed to, like, build...

254
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:52,025
...marketing or cust- like user acquisition
basically, um, and especially after we raised...

255
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:56,369
...our series B, the, like, traditional way you
were supposed to do that is to, like,...

256
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:00,946
...hire a marketing executive and build out,
like, a marketing team and, um, and just,...

257
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:04,792
...like, basically spin up this machine
to do, like, sales and marketing.

258
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:10,572
But I'd actually met, like, a
YC founder, um, Mike, who was...

259
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,052
His company was basically building,
like, a smart frying pan.

260
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:16,121
Sounds, like, bizarre, but, like, he
was a MIT engineer. I remember.

261
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:16,921
Yeah, you remember this?

262
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:20,385
Um, he's an MIT engineer, and to
sell the smart frying pan- Awesome. ... he...

263
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,774
...had to get really, really
good at understanding, like, paid advertising...

264
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:26,140
...and, um, uh, Google Ads,
and just a whole bunch of stuff.

265
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:29,963
And so he, he'd taken this
engineer's mindset approach to it, and I...

266
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:33,269
...remember just talking to him about it
and realizing this would be so...

267
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:36,855
...much better to have an MIT
engineer working on, like, our marketing...

268
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:40,312
...efforts than any of the
marketing candidates I've spoken to.

269
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:43,001
And he was able to,
like, scale us up to, like...

270
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:45,782
I mean we were spending, like,
at one point, like, a million dollars...

271
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:48,231
...a month on just marketing and various,
like, campaigns.

272
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,751
And, and Triplebyte had great marketing.

273
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:49,860
Yeah.

274
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,748
Like, I remember, like, the Caltrain- Yeah.
... station takeover that you did, all the,...

275
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:57,432
...like, out of home stuff that you did,
it was, like, really high quality stuff.

276
00:15:57,451 --> 00:15:58,501
It stuck with the...

277
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:00,741
You could tell that it was not
being done by some, like- Yeah. ...

278
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:01,351
VP of marketing person.

279
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,652
And, th- um, and that was all Mike.

280
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,429
And, like, the comment I would
often get when people would ask me...

281
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,028
...around that time, like, "How big
is Triplebyte?" And we were like 50...

282
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:11,692
...people, and I would be able
to be- It felt so much better.

283
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:12,061
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:15,034
We'd be like, "Oh, there's like
hundreds of people." I was like,...

285
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:17,855
..."No, it's all because if you
put a really smart engineer on...

286
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:20,182
...some of these, like,
tasks, they just find ways to make...

287
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:23,162
They find leverage." And now,
like, LLMs can go even way beyond,...

288
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,471
...like, the leverage
you had with just pure software.

289
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:29,971
Okay, so here's my pitch
for 300 vertical AI agent unicorns.

290
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:34,942
Literally every company that is a SaaS
unicorn you could imagine, there is a vertical...

291
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:39,284
...AI unicorn equivalent in, like, some new
universe. 'Cause like most of these SaaS...

292
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:43,357
...unicorns, beforehand, there were some,
like, box software company that was...

293
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:47,157
...making the same thing that got disrupted
by a SaaS company, and you could...

294
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:51,395
...easily imagine the same thing happening
again, where now basically every S-...

295
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:55,131
...every SaaS company builds some software
that some group of people use.

296
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,869
The vertical AI equivalent
is just going to be the...

297
00:16:57,869 --> 00:17:00,270
...software plus
the people in one product.

298
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:03,565
One thing might be just enterprises
in general right now are a little...

299
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,531
...unsure about what exactly they,
like what agents they need.

300
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,361
And one approach I've seen from
especially more experienced founders like, um,...

301
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:13,692
...Brett Taylor, the CTO of
Facebook, started this company, Sierra.

302
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:18,431
I don't know all the details, but as
far as I can tell, it's essentially more, like,...

303
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:22,474
...broadly about letting enterprises, like, deploy
these AI agents and spinning them...

304
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,709
...up, like, custom for the enterprise versus
like, "Oh, hey, we have, like, this...

305
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,956
...specific agent to do this." It's something
I've seen from one of my companies...

306
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:34,372
...called, um, uh, Vectorshift that
we funded about a year ago.

307
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:40,142
They're two really smart, like, Harvard
computer scientists, and it's a, they're...

308
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:44,070
What they found is that they're trying
to build a platform to make it easy...

309
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,170
...for enterprises to build their own,
like, use, like, no code or SDKs...

310
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,751
...to build their own,
like, um, internal LLM powered agents.

311
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,061
But, like,
enterprises often don't know exactly...

312
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,592
...what they want to use these things for.

313
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:59,203
And so, bringing it back, I wonder if,
like, in, like, the box software world,...

314
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,705
...you started off with just, like, a
few vendors who just basically were trying...

315
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:06,128
...to convince people to use software at
all- Yeah. ... and it was just like,...

316
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:09,486
...it does everything, um, and then
it gets more sophisticated and higher...

317
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:12,471
...resolution and you get lots of,
like, vertical SaaS players.

318
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:16,859
We go through that same period with LLMs
where the early winners might just be these, like,...

319
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,330
...general purpose, "Hey, like, we, like, make it
easy for you to do LLM stuff," and then...

320
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,388
...it...... the vertical agents will come in
over time, or do you think there's...

321
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:29,431
...reasons it's different now and the vertical
agents will take off on day one?

322
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:32,117
Yeah, that's interesting,
'cause if you think about the...

323
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:34,551
...history of SaaS,
the consumer things worked first.

324
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:40,741
Like, 2005 to 2010 was mostly consumer
applications like email and chat and maps.

325
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:44,916
And people got, y- people, uh, as
individuals, got used to using these tools...

326
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,407
...themselves, and I think that made it
easier to sell SaaS tools to companies...

327
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,771
...because, you know, the same
people are both employees and consumers.

328
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,281
Yeah.

329
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:57,012
I, I think the answer might just be,
like, this is, this is all just a continuation...

330
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,401
...of software and just there's no
reason it has to reset back.

331
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:04,922
Like, LLMs don't have to reset back
to a few general purpose, like, enterprise...

332
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:08,922
...LLM platforms doing everything, because
enterprises have already been trained...

333
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:12,830
...on, like, the value of
point solutions and vertical solutions.

334
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:15,791
Um, and, like, the user experience
is not going to be that different.

335
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,971
These things will
just be a lot more powerful.

336
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:22,421
And so if enterprises have already
built the muscle of believing that, like,...

337
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:26,475
...startups or vertical solutions can
be better than, like, legacy broad...

338
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:30,372
...platforms, they are probably
going to be willing to take a bet on a...

339
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:34,271
...startup promising a very
good vertical AI agent solution today.

340
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,898
And I feel like we're all seeing
that in the batch now, where some of...

341
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:41,128
...our companies are getting
faster traction in enterprises for...

342
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:44,991
...these vertical AI agents than,
like, we've ever seen before.

343
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,391
I think we're just early in the game,
right?

344
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:50,606
Like, all software sort of starts
quite vertical, and then as the...

345
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:55,061
...industries actually get much
more developed, um, then...

346
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,291
I mean,
I just answered my earlier question.

347
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,942
It's like, you know, why does a
company end up having a thousand employees?

348
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:06,066
It's actually that, uh, you know, early,
early in the game everyone's making these...

349
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:10,531
...specific point solutions, and then at
some point you've got to go horizontal.

350
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:15,058
Like, you're already doing this crazy spend
on sales and marketing, and then the...

351
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,584
...only way you can actually continue to grow
once you sort of get 100% or, you...

352
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:24,583
...know, some large majority of the market,
is you actually have to do, like,...

353
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,601
...not just a point solution,
but things that sort of work together.

354
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:32,888
Maybe the other point of why the bull
case for vertical AI agents could be even...

355
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:38,054
...bigger than SaaS is that SaaS, you still
needed a operations team or set of people...

356
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:43,071
...to operate the software in
order to get all the workflows to be done.

357
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,721
I don't know, approval workflows or
you have to input the data.

358
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:50,286
The argument here is that you will
get not only replacing all that set of...

359
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:53,770
...SaaS software, so that would
be, like, one-to-one mapping, but it's...

360
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,400
...also going to eat all of
the, a lot of the payroll. Totally.

361
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,008
Because you look a lot
of the spend for companies, big...

362
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,371
...chunk is still a payroll,
and software's tiny.

363
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:05,111
Exactly. They spend way more on
employees than they do on software.

364
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:09,789
So it'll be these smaller companies that
are way more efficient, that need way...

365
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:14,481
...less humans to do random data entry
or approvals or click the software.

366
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,081
I agree.

367
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:18,328
I think it's very possible that
the vertical equivalents will be 10...

368
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:21,641
...times as large as the
SaaS company that they are disrupting.

369
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:21,661
Yeah.

370
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:22,471
I mean there's, there's two case.

371
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,247
It could be that the vertical
point solution could be just big enough...

372
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:29,661
...and you don't need to
do that bra- breadth thing, right?

373
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,340
It, that could be another scenario.

374
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,411
Should we give some examples?

375
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:35,254
I feel like we've all been-
Now's a good time to talk about some. ...

376
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:38,215
working with so many vertical AI
agent companies, we've got, like, news...

377
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,071
...from the front- Yeah.
... of like- ... how it's actually going.

378
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,557
Well, your former, uh, head of
product, Aaron Cannon, is working on a...

379
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:49,678
...YC company called Outset that
I worked with and, uh, basically...

380
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:53,311
...they're taking LLMs,
uh, to the surveys and Qualtrics space.

381
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:57,013
So Qualtrics is almost
certainly not really going to build the...

382
00:21:57,013 --> 00:22:00,619
...best of breed, uh,
large language model with reasoning.

383
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,811
And then the funny thing about surveys is,
you know, who's it actually for?

384
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:08,401
It's for people who run products, for marketing
teams, it's for people who are trying to...

385
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:12,551
...make sense of, like, what do our
customers actually want, and what are surveys?

386
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,431
Like, guess what? That's language.

387
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:20,224
So, um, and then I feel like these
types of businesses, um, actually have to thread...

388
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:26,167
...this needle, um, because enterprise and SMB
software often is sold based on a particular...

389
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:31,658
...person who is the key decision-maker, and, um,
you have to go high enough in the...

390
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:36,298
...organization so that the people you're
selling to are not afraid that their...

391
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:40,590
...whole, their job and or their whole
team's job is going to go away.

392
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:41,261
Yeah.

393
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:41,641
Totally.

394
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:44,947
That's kind of the move that I seen
that a lot of companies that sell need...

395
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,447
...to do, because if you're going to
go and sell to the team that's going...

396
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:52,031
...to get replaced by AI- Oh yeah,
they're gonna sabotage it, man.

397
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,131
Yep. ... it just does not work.

398
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:53,172
Yeah.

399
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:57,334
So I think this is a interesting way that
a lot of these are top down and you...

400
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,381
...have to go through, at some point even
get the CEO to sign off on it.

401
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:01,871
Yeah.

402
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:05,872
A company I'm working with, uh, Momentic,
that's sort of a, essentially an AI...

403
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:08,771
...agent, but for at least where
they're starting is, like, QA testing.

404
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:13,848
Um, they're actually getting really great
traction right now, and it's interesting because...

405
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:17,931
...do you remember a decade ago,
um, YCombinator we worked with Rainforest QA.

406
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:22,416
Like, Rainforest was a QA as a
service company, and that they had this exact...

407
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:26,771
...tension of where they couldn't actually replace
your QA team, and so they needed...

408
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,969
...to build software that made the
QA team more, like, efficient, but really...

409
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:35,101
...that obviously meant trying to replace
as many of them as possible.

410
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:39,118
They couldn't replace the whole team, and so
they were always on this sort of, like,...

411
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,392
...tightrope between trying to sell the software
to, like, the head of engineering- ...

412
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:46,838
and said this will mean you'll need
less QA people, and great, but then you...

413
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:50,511
...also have to go sell that to the
QA team who don't want to be replaced.

414
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:53,241
And so I think that was always,
like, a friction for that...

415
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,501
...business for how it could,
like, scale and grow.

416
00:23:55,531 --> 00:24:00,411
But now, like, Momentic with AI
can actually just replace the QA people.

417
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:04,447
So their pitch is not, oh, this, like,
makes your QA people faster, it's like, this just...

418
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:08,290
...means you don't need a QA team at all,
so they can just focus the sale onto, like,...

419
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,811
...engineering and engineering
doesn't need buy-in from QA at this point.

420
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:13,181
And you can also go in...

421
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:16,122
I mean, to start with, you can
go and sell to companies that don't even...

422
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,424
...have big QA teams at the moment,
they just use something like...

423
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,071
...Momentic and then it will just,
like, keep scaling with them.

424
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,391
Scaling and they'll just never build
a QA team- Yeah. ... ever.

425
00:24:23,411 --> 00:24:23,491
Yeah.

426
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,341
Yes.

427
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:27,672
That is a real life case study of
what Diana was saying about why these vertical...

428
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:30,791
...AI agent companies can be 10 times
as big as the SaaS companies.

429
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:34,211
Yeah. I'm seeing this interesting
now, um, like in recruiting too.

430
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:35,571
I had this exact same issue with Oh. ...

431
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,377
Triplebyte- ... where to build the software,
um, to build software that makes it...

432
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,813
...easy to, like, screen and hire
software engineers you need buy-in from both...

433
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:46,458
...the engineering team that they're
joining, but also their recruiting team,...

434
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,827
...and effectively the software we were
building was trying to replace the...

435
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:52,840
...recruiters, but we couldn't
completely replace the recruiters.

436
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,731
But now within YC there's- Yeah,
and so the recruiters were always, like,...

437
00:24:56,731 --> 00:25:00,900
...uh...... opposing- Yeah. ... opposing it
'cause it was a threat to them.

438
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,229
Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,290
So it was always, like, friction on like how,
um, on like how far you can get when...

440
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,619
...the customer you're trying to sell
to is worried about being replaced.

441
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,730
Um, but yeah.

442
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:15,925
I think now, it's still early days,
but now with AI you can...

443
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:19,628
...build things that do the whole stack,
like of recruiting.

444
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,510
We have a company we worked with last,
Patrick, Nico worked with them,...

445
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,920
...apriora, which is actually just doing
like the full like technical screen,...

446
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,519
...the full initial recruiter screen,
and getting great traction.

447
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,750
So I think as those things keep going,
like they won't have...

448
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,629
The, the same thing,
you won't have the friction of,...

449
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:35,359
...oh, I need to
convince recruiters to use this.

450
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,358
You'll probably just,
like, not build a recruiting...

451
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:40,519
...team in the same way that you used to.

452
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,398
I mean, other w- example
is even for dev tool companies,...

453
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:47,980
...they have to do a lot of,
uh, developer support.

454
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:53,792
And I work with this
company called Capilot.ai that basically built...

455
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:58,186
...one of the best chatbots that responds
to a lot of the, a lot...

456
00:25:58,186 --> 00:26:02,759
...of the technical details, uh,
that are hard to answer.

457
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:06,861
And I think a lot of the
companies that started using them, they actually...

458
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:11,278
...ended up having DevRel teams that are
a lot smaller- Mm-hmm. ... because it...

459
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,230
...ingests a lot of, uh,
the developer documentations, even the YouTube...

460
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,859
...videos that c- dev tools put up,
and even a lot of the chat history.

461
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,259
So it just keeps getting
better and better, and is...

462
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:23,650
...like, gives really
good answers actually.

463
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,700
It's one, one of the best I've seen.

464
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,552
Yeah, I also worked with a
customer support, uh, like an AI...

465
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:30,809
...customer support
agent company called PowerHelp.

466
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:30,849
Mm-hmm.

467
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:35,019
Well, actually- Yeah. ...
we- w- we both did, um, last batch.

468
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:38,740
And I learned a couple
interesting things from PowerHelp.

469
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,164
Um, the first is customer sup-
like AI agents for customer support...

470
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:45,779
...was like the category that's
like famously crowded, where there's...

471
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,849
...like supposedly like,
you know, a hundred of them.

472
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,688
And if you go and you
google like AI customer support- Yeah.

473
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:54,388
... agent, you'll get like
a hundred results on Google.

474
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,501
Um, but what I learned
through working with PowerHelp...

475
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,579
...is, like,
it's actually kind of bullshit.

476
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,639
Like, like, almost all of those
companies are doing very simple, like,...

477
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:06,569
...zero-shot LLM prompting that can't
actually replace a real customer...

478
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:10,490
...support team that does a
lot of really complicated w- workflows.

479
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,308
It just kind of
makes for like a nice demo.

480
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,464
Like, to actually replace a customer
support team for like an at scale...

481
00:27:15,464 --> 00:27:18,222
...company that has like a hundred
customer support reps that do lots of...

482
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,513
...complicated things every day, you
need like really complicated software...

483
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:24,249
...that does all the stuff
that like Jay Keller was talking about.

484
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,379
And there's on- there were only like three
or four...

485
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,730
...companies that were
even attempting to do that.

486
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,690
And cumulative they ha- cumulatively they
had like less than 1% market penetration.

487
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,880
And so the market
was just completely open.

488
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,433
I could also see
that being another case of, um,...

489
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:40,028
...hyper-specialization
or hyper-verticalization.

490
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:40,430
Yeah.

491
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,349
Like there's not going to be...

492
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,621
I mean, maybe eventually there could
be a single general-purpose customer support...

493
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:50,616
...agent- Yeah. ... software company, but
we're like in inning, you know, that,...

494
00:27:50,616 --> 00:27:53,970
...that'll be like an eighth or
ninth inning kind of thing. Totally.

495
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,650
And we're literally in the first inning.

496
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,262
So, you know, instead, you know,
you're going to have companies like GigaML...

497
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:04,475
...that, you know, it's doing it
for Zepto doing 30,000 tickets, uh,...

498
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:08,730
...every single day and replacing a,
a team of a thousand people.

499
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:08,789
Yeah.

500
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,077
And, but it's very specific and it has,
you know, it's...

501
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:14,839
...not a general-purpose
demoware kind of thing.

502
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,999
Like it's 10,000 test cases and
a very detailed, uh, eval set that,...

503
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:25,039
...you know, is basically just
for Zepto and things like Zepto.

504
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:25,450
Yeah.

505
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,420
Uh, but if you are, you know,
any of the other marketplace companies,...

506
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,126
...you're probably gonna use it, 'cause
like that's a very well-defined kind...

507
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:36,700
...of marketplace that's,
you know, instant delivery marketplace.

508
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,634
I think this is the kind- Mm-hmm. ...
of dynamic that led there to be like...

509
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:43,335
...$300 billion SaaS companies rather than
like one like $10 trillion like...

510
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,960
...meta SaaS thing that provides
all the software for the world.

511
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,020
It's just like the customers just
require really heavily, like, tailored solutions...

512
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,200
...and it's hard to build one
that like works for every, everyone.

513
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,410
Exactly.

514
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,227
I mean, we already
gave three examples of customer...

515
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:57,069
...support, but they
are very different verticals.

516
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:57,079
Yeah.

517
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:00,902
It's like dev tool companies, very
different kind of support that you need,...

518
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:04,160
...and the training set to
marketplace is very different, right?

519
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,332
Yeah, I guess whether you have agents or real
human beings working for you, you end up with...

520
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:14,385
...the same problem, which is every company
bumps up against Coase's theory of the firm,...

521
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:19,532
...which says that- Mm-hmm. ... any given firm
will grow only so much to the point where...

522
00:29:19,532 --> 00:29:24,519
...it, uh, becomes inefficient to be larger
than that, and then that's why there are...

523
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,159
...sort of, uh, networks and ecosystems
and, you know, a full-blown economy.

524
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,759
You know, like every firm will sort
of specialize to do what it is particularly...

525
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,570
...good at, and then the limits, the
outer limits of what those firms can...

526
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:42,240
...be, it's actually based on,
uh, m- your ability as a manager.

527
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:46,625
So yeah, that, that part a little
bit breaks my brain because, you know, when...

528
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:50,537
...we spend time with Parker Conrad at
Rippling, uh, one of his favorite points...

529
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:54,901
...is actually, well, you know, everyone's
very obsessed with, with, uh, the...

530
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:58,114
...fact that the rocks can talk and,
you know, maybe they can draw, but...

531
00:29:58,114 --> 00:30:01,569
...the more interesting thing for him,
you know, running HRIT software...

532
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:04,960
...that, uh, you know,
he spends a lot of time thinking about HR.

533
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,460
Like actually the coolest thing about
LLMs is that the rocks can read.

534
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:09,759
Yeah.

535
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:14,319
And from his perspective, like, you know,
he's, he, I think he has 3,000 employees.

536
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,880
He still runs payroll for
all 3,000 employees through Rippling.

537
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,797
So I think he spends a
lot of time thinking about like, how...

538
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:24,920
...can one person extend their ability
as a manager?

539
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,559
And, uh,
I think we're gonna see a lot more there.

540
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:34,062
That would be in a, a reverse argument
that if we're at this moment where, uh, tools...

541
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:38,972
...for managers and CEOs are going to
get much more powerful, um, then- Oh, it...

542
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:43,279
...could- it could- it could increase the
scale of the firm that you can run.

543
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:43,700
Right.

544
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,409
And that's certainly
what Rippling is trying to do.

545
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,509
Yeah, this is sort of the war, right?
Mm-hmm.

546
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:49,104
Like he's- he's- he's attempting
to build this like suite of HR tools...

547
00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:51,678
...where if he wins- Yeah. ...
he's gonna eat a whole bunch of billion...

548
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:53,960
...dollar SaaS companies in like one,
one giant company.

549
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,470
It's a very- Yeah.
... interesting point, Gary.

550
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:59,493
I think what made me think about this is
that with having all these AI...

551
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:03,811
...SaaS tools is gonna...... give the
ability to all these leaders and...

552
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:07,764
...all these orgs, who basically
open the aperture of the context...

553
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:12,178
...window, or how much information
they can- Oh, yeah. ... parse.

554
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:12,277
Mm-hmm.

555
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,643
Because there's a limit of how much, uh,
as humans...

556
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:16,367
...we can have meaningful relationship.

557
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:18,417
There's like the whole thing
with the Dunbar number- Oh, yeah.

558
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:21,292
It's about 300 people that you can- 150.
... 150, that...

559
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:24,307
...you can have a
meaningful relationship with.

560
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:28,100
But with AI, because all these
rocks now can read, I think we...

561
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,827
...will be able to extend
that Dunbar limit that we have.

562
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:35,591
Yeah, I think, uh,
Flo Crivello had this interesting...

563
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:38,557
...post on Twitter
that went viral around, um...

564
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:43,861
I think someone had made a voice chat,
like just weekend project as a CEO,...

565
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:48,548
...but it would call, uh, all
1,500- Right. ... of their employees.

566
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,488
Mm. Yeah.

567
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:53,177
And, uh, you know, it was, you
know, a very short call, like kind of...

568
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,877
...sounded like it was from the CEO,
just asking kind of personally.

569
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,338
I mean, it sort of reminds me of, um,
that scene in Her where it zooms out and, uh,...

570
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:06,012
...actually, you know, you're following the
experience of one person using the Her...

571
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:09,917
...OS, but actually, that Her OS
is actually speaking to 15, you know,...

572
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:13,877
...thousands or tens of thousands of people
all at- Oh, yeah. ... one time.

573
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:17,048
How- how many others? 8316.

574
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:21,647
Yeah, I mean, large language models
can talk and can have conversations.

575
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:26,867
And then to what extent can, uh,
you know, this power actually extend the...

576
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:32,448
...capability of one or a few people to,
uh, understand what's going on?

577
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:33,827
I, I, I heard about that use case.

578
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:37,414
It got, it definitely got me thinking
because I, as I understood it, the...

579
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,317
...product is something that you just,
it will call up all your employees and...

580
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:43,044
...then your employees can just like
ramble about what they've been doing and...

581
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,670
...it will just extract the meaning out
of it and give the CEO like ev-...

582
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,508
...like bullet point summary
of here's the most important stuff.

583
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:52,812
And there were a bunch of like SaaS
companies that attempt to do these sort of like...

584
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:57,268
...weekly pulse, pulses from employees
using like traditional SaaS software.

585
00:32:57,288 --> 00:33:00,032
But like, that version
is literally 100 times better...

586
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:02,218
...than the pre-LLM version of this idea.

587
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:08,258
But I wonder with like that particular
tool, um, just like i- i- it's not...

588
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:11,268
It's going beyond just like reading
and summarizing.

589
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:14,526
Like this, this is the argument of like,
if writing is thinking then...

590
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,453
...like there's actually just a huge
amount of work that's involved in...

591
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,577
...the effort of figuring out
like who's an effective communicator...

592
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:23,478
...and like what are the
most important things to be like...

593
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:26,347
What, what are the key things
to be focused on as a company?

594
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:29,871
And I just wonder if that, uh, at
some point do the LLMs do like, they go...

595
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:33,348
...beyond just like summarizing and
reading and doing actual thinking, at...

596
00:33:33,348 --> 00:33:36,768
...which point like who's
actually running the, the organization?

597
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:38,228
Yes.

598
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,417
Interesting thought.

599
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:46,016
I guess the other thing that's kind
of interesting about how Parker Conrad's thinking about...

600
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:51,400
...it is, um, I found out about this
recently off, uh, an interview with Matt McInnis, his...

601
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,586
...COO, that, uh, there are more than 100
founders who work at Rippling now, as sort...

602
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:59,968
...of specific people who run like
an entire SaaS vertical inside Rippling.

603
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:02,038
It's super cool the
way he's built the team.

604
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,874
Har- Harsh probably
knows a l- lot about it because...

605
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,548
...you've done a
bunch of interviews with him.

606
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:12,117
Um, yeah, I mean, it's definitely
very focused on, uh, recruiting founders and...

607
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:16,110
Uh, I mean, uh, Parker, uh,
like Rippling is essentially the, the case...

608
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,478
...against vertical, like,
or verticalization of software, right?

609
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:24,208
He's actively trying to, uh, horizontalize and
take over all of HR and IT software.

610
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:24,507
Yeah.

611
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:24,688
Yeah.

612
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,969
Like the whole thesis is
basically there's this underlying platform...

613
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,470
...that has like lots of value
and he wants to recruit founders...

614
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,047
...and teams
that build on top of that platform.

615
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,403
Like it's almost a little
bit more sort of like Amazon-esque-...

616
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:37,208
...Yeah. ...
where it's like shared infrastructure.

617
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:40,225
Um- Yeah, I think
every product that they've released,...

618
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,588
...I mean,
things like time tracking and whatnot.

619
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:46,598
I mean, basically they launch a
thing and it hits like multi-millions...

620
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:49,208
...of dollars in
ARR on day one of launching.

621
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,748
And that's exactly what
we were talking about earlier.

622
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:56,078
Like once you, once you have a vertical,
once you have a toehold, what you're saying...

623
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:59,748
...is, "Well, I have to spend
this money on sales and marketing anyway.

624
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:03,575
Can I, uh, you know,
basically get higher LTV and hold my...

625
00:35:03,575 --> 00:35:06,447
...CAC constant?" And,
uh, that's sort of what...

626
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:10,081
If you, if you look at all the
top, uh, software companies today, it's like that's...

627
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:13,117
...what Oracle is, that's what
Microsoft is, that's what Salesforce is.

628
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,367
Rippling, knock on wood,
going to be the next.

629
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:19,263
But, um, it's,
it's an interesting alternative to,...

630
00:35:19,263 --> 00:35:22,646
...uh, going from zero
to one totally on your own.

631
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:25,088
Do you guys want to talk about
some of the voice companies that we have?

632
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:28,507
I think that's like an interesting,
like, subcategory of...

633
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:31,547
...this, of this stuff
that's like really blowing up now.

634
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:37,431
I have a company that I work with
called Salient that basically does AI voice calling to...

635
00:35:37,431 --> 00:35:44,004
...automate a lot of debt collection in
the auto lending space, which traditionally- So they...

636
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:49,487
...like call up people and are like,
"Hey, you owe $1,000 on your car." Yeah.

637
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:52,233
Which actually- "What's
up with that?" Actually, this...

638
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,378
...kind of job is one
of those butter passing job.

639
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:58,571
It kind of sucks because a lot of,
uh, these low wage workers work in...

640
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:02,418
...all these call centers
and it's like a terrible boring job.

641
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:05,744
So very high churn and giant
headcount to run these because there's...

642
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:09,088
...just so many accounts with these banks
that have to do that.

643
00:36:09,097 --> 00:36:14,268
And this is a perfect task
that AI could automate.

644
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:18,621
And what Salient has done is, has been
able to actually get very, very accurate and...

645
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:22,668
...it has been going live with a
lot of big banks, which is super exciting.

646
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:27,483
And this was a company from last
year and demonstrating that, that part of it...

647
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:31,557
...that they were able to get in
because they sold through top down.

648
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,771
I guess the space feels like
it's moving very quickly and that we...

649
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:38,301
...have incredible companies
that are voice infra companies, like...

650
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:41,797
...Vapi, and then people
can sort of get started right away.

651
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:42,757
And retail also.

652
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:46,854
I mean, these are companies that
have reached pretty fast scale just because...

653
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:51,097
...it's one of the more exciting,
like mind-blowing things that you can get...

654
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:55,307
...up and running within,
I mean, literally the course of hours.

655
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:59,095
Um-And then some of the question that,
you know, remains unanswered,...

656
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:02,663
...and we hope they figure it out,
is how do you hold onto them?

657
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:08,143
Especially as you, uh, run into
things like the new OpenAI voice APIs.

658
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:10,952
Um, you know, do you go direct?

659
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:15,595
Like, you prob- it's probably way more
work to try to use the underlying...

660
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:19,583
...APIs off the bat, but
these, uh, platforms are clearly low-bar.

661
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:22,371
And then the question is
can you keep raising the ceiling...

662
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:25,173
...so that you can
hold onto customers forever?

663
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,771
Harj, you were making an
interesting point earlier about, like,...

664
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:31,627
...how the apps that people have
built on top of LMs has changed...

665
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,413
...from, like,
early 2023 when it started until now.

666
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:36,583
Yeah. Voice, which we were just talking
about, is a great example of this.

667
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:39,043
I think even if you went six months back,
it felt...

668
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:41,802
...like the voices
were not realistic enough yet.

669
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:43,322
The latency was too high.

670
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:48,146
Like, there was n- W- It felt like we
were probably a ways off having AI voice apps...

671
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:52,603
...that could meaningfully, like, replace,
like, humans calling people up.

672
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,262
And, like, here we are.

673
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:59,468
And yeah, we're just sort of zooming out,
thinking back to the...

674
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:03,713
...first YC batch
where LLM-powered apps first came in.

675
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:08,023
It was probably winter 2023,
so, you know, almost two years ago now.

676
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:11,348
And the apps were essentially just things
that spat out...

677
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:14,313
...some text,
and not even, like, perfect text.

678
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:15,722
The rocks could talk, that's about it.

679
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:16,253
Yeah, right?

680
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,983
Sort of more like copyediting,
marketing edit- Yeah. ... email edits.

681
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:22,773
It was just, uh, kind of more,
like, just, like, incremental.

682
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:24,353
Yeah. Like I re- I had a company...

683
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:27,961
I mean, the one that sticks in
my head is a company called Speedy Brand,...

684
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:31,530
...and all, what they did is make
it very easy for, like, a small business...

685
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,693
...to just generate a blog
and spit out content marketing.

686
00:38:34,782 --> 00:38:36,253
Um, it was like a very obvious idea.

687
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:41,253
And it wasn't perfect, but it was
pretty cool at the time, and that's what...

688
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:43,008
We've talked about it a bunch on the show,
but that was like...

689
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:44,733
...the ChatGBT wrapper,
it turned out, around that time.

690
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:47,417
So hey, like, this is what
an LLM app looks like, it's...

691
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,932
...just a ChatGBT wrapper,
it does very basic...

692
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:50,943
Spits out some text.

693
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:55,342
Like, it's going to get crushed by OpenAI
in their next release. Like- And it did.

694
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:55,963
Yeah.

695
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:59,365
Well, I don- I don- I don't
know if- No, Speed- ... that one did,...

696
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:02,006
...but- but the- that- that first,
that first wave of LLM apps...

697
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,592
...mostly did get crushed
by the next wave of- Right. ...

698
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:04,871
GPTs, yeah.

699
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,077
But I- I feel like we've had
this sort of boiling of the frog effect,...

700
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,939
...where from our perspe- it's sort
of like every f- three months,...

701
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:13,362
...things have just
kept getting progressively better.

702
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:17,401
And now we're at this point where
we're talking about, like, full-on vertical AI...

703
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:21,242
...agents that are going to replace
entire teams and functions and enterprises.

704
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:24,932
Um, and just that progression is
still mind-blowing to me.

705
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:29,393
Like, we're two years in, which
is still relatively early, and the rate...

706
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:33,152
...of progress is just,
like, unlike anything we've seen before.

707
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:37,168
And I think what's interesting to see is,
we discussed this in the last episode,...

708
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:40,923
...is a lot of the foundation
models are kind of coming head-to-head.

709
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:44,784
There used to be only one player
in town with OpenAI- Mm-hmm. ... but...

710
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:47,742
...we've been seeing in
the last batch this has been changing.

711
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,403
Claude is a huge contender.

712
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:54,365
Thank God. 'Cause like competition is, you
know, the- the soil for a very...

713
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:59,232
...fertile marketplace ecosystem, uh, for
which consumers will have choice, and,...

714
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:03,623
...uh, founders have a shot,
and that's the world I want to live in.

715
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:07,541
So people are watching and thinking
about starting a startup or maybe...

716
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:11,472
...have already started,
and, uh, they're hearing all of this.

717
00:40:11,523 --> 00:40:14,822
How do you know what
the right vertical is for you?

718
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:20,603
You got to find some boring,
repetitive admin work somewhere.

719
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:25,502
And that seems to be just, like, the common
thread across- Yes. ... all of this stuff, is...

720
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:30,593
...if you can find a boring, repetitive admin
task, um, there is likely going to be a...

721
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:34,762
...billion-dollar AI agent startup
if you keep digging deep enough into it.

722
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:38,374
But it sounds like you should
go after something that you directly...

723
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:41,663
...have some sort of experience
or relationship to.

724
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:45,613
That is a common, like, that
is definitely a common thread I've seen...

725
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:48,463
...in the companies that are,
that I'm seeing promise with.

726
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,403
And- and another one just
pops into my head, Sweet Spot.

727
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:54,490
I think I mentioned on this before, like,
they're basically building an AI agent to bid on...

728
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:58,140
...government contracts, and the way they found that
idea, and this is a year ago, was they...

729
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,833
...just had a friend whose full-time job was
to sit there on, like, a government website,...

730
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:05,163
...like, refreshing the page,
like, looking for new proposals to bid on.

731
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:08,529
And they- they were pivoting, and they
were like, "Oh, like, that seems like something...

732
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:12,110
...an LLM could do." Um, a company from
a recent batch which pivoted into a new...

733
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,240
...idea that's getting great traction,
like, they're basically building an AI...

734
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,293
...agent to do, um, processes
like medical billing for dental clinics.

735
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:20,948
And the way they found the idea was,
um, one of the founder's...

736
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:23,883
...mothers is a dentist, and so he
just decided to go to work with...

737
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:26,384
...her for a day and just sit there,
seeing what she did.

738
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,007
And he's like, "Oh,
like, all of that, like,...

739
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,742
...processing claims seems,
like, really boring.

740
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:33,074
Like, an LLM should totally be able
to do that." And he just started...

741
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,963
...writing software for,
like, his mother's dental clinic.

742
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:40,123
So I guess, I mean, in robotics,
the classic maxim is, uh, you...

743
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,507
...know, the robots that are going
to be profitable and that are...

744
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:47,384
...going to work are going to be,
um, dirty and dangerous jobs.

745
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:53,663
And in this case, for vertical
SaaS, look for boring- ... butter-passing jobs.

746
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:55,003
Yeah.

747
00:41:55,023 --> 00:41:57,663
Well, with that,
we're out of time for today.

748
00:41:57,702 --> 00:42:07,022
We'll catch you on the light...

749
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:12,742
...cone next time.
